#This program records the number of children under six whose blood lead level is at least 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood (Î¼g/dL) in the specific borough and year. Choose Option a to group by borough, report average of number of affected children in each borough. Enter a specific borough. Report the minimum, maximum, and average number of affected children in those years. Choose Option b to group by year, report average of number of affected children in each year. Enter a specific year. Report the minimum, maximum, and average number of affected children in the boroughs.
